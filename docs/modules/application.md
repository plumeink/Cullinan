# cullinan.application

`cullinan.application` is the semantic package for application definition and
advanced public application composition. Regular applications should prefer the shorter
top-level `cullinan` startup API, but maintainers and advanced integrations
still land here when they need the fuller application model:

> **Advanced-but-public module:** this page documents a real semantic layer, not the default first-read path.
> Prefer [Getting Started](../getting_started.md) and the top-level `cullinan` API for new applications.

- `@application` declares the default entry method
- `@configure(...)` attaches startup settings to that method
- calling the entry method starts through the curated top-level API
- `@module` declares an advanced boundary when you need module ownership, reload, and hot-pluggable runtime behavior
- top-level `run()` / `get_asgi_app()` are the shortest public startup path

The bootstrap contract also depends on the framework semantics documented in [Framework Semantics](../framework_semantics.md): component discovery is import-executed, automatic scanning only guarantees module-top-level decorated components, and structural registration freezes after `refresh()`.

In practice, most application code starts from business decorators and an entry method.
`@module` is not a manual app-registration center; it is the advanced boundary
that keeps ownership, reload, draining, and runtime switching explicit and stable.

## Recommended bootstrap

```python
from cullinan import application, configure, controller, get_api, service


@service
class GreetingService:
    def greet(self) -> str:
        return "hello"


@controller(url="/api")
class GreetingController:
    greeting_service: GreetingService  # ← 构造注入

    @get_api(url="/whoami")
    def whoami(self):
        return {"message": self.greeting_service.greet()}


@configure(user_packages=["myapp"])
@application
def main(): ...

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

## When to use `@module`

Do **not** start with `@module` for a normal single-package application. The entry method is the default path.

Reach for `@module` when you need one or more of these:

- explicit package ownership boundaries
- multiple business domains with clear runtime separation
- hot-pluggable modules or plugin-style assembly
- stricter reload / draining / ownership semantics than the default startup path

## Module ownership and boundaries

`@module` uses Python package ownership to discover components. When a component
matches more than one module package, startup fails fast. Resolve intentional
overlap with `ownership_overrides`.

```python
@module(
    imports=[SharedModule, OrdersModule],
    ownership_overrides={"myapp.shared": SharedModule},
)
class RootModule:
    pass
```

## Runtime switching

`Application.reload()` builds a fresh candidate runtime, validates and warms it,
then atomically switches the active application. The previous runtime enters
draining state, and `Application.current()` continues to resolve the
request-bound snapshot until the in-flight request ends.

## Maintainer / advanced note

`ApplicationContext` remains the low-level container/runtime primitive, and
`Application` remains available from `cullinan.application` for advanced
runtime-aware composition. New application setup should still start from
business decorators plus the top-level entry-method path.
