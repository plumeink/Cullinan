# Runtime consolidation overview

This page summarizes the three major updates currently reflected in the codebase and documentation.

## 1. IoC/DI consolidation

The container model is now centered on `ApplicationContext` and publicly surfaced through `cullinan.core`.

### What changed

- `cullinan.core` became the public facade for container, lifecycle, and context APIs
- `ApplicationContext.refresh()` / `shutdown()` are the primary lifecycle transitions
- compatibility modules under `cullinan.core.container.*` now forward to the same core implementation
- legacy constructor-injection helpers are compatibility shims, not the recommended model

### What to use now

- `@service`, `@controller`
- `Inject()` and `InjectByName()`
- `ApplicationContext` for explicit registration or integration work

## 2. Web Runtime consolidation

The web stack was reorganized around a transport-agnostic runtime in `cullinan.gateway`.

### What changed

- `WebRequest`, `WebResponse`, and `WebAdapter` define the current public HTTP abstraction
- `Router`, `Dispatcher`, `MiddlewarePipeline`, and `ExceptionHandler` now live behind the gateway facade
- `cullinan.gateway.web_core` owns the shared request/response model
- adapters are separated into `cullinan.adapter` (`TornadoAdapter`, `ASGIAdapter`)

### Migration implication

Use the unified Web Runtime names in new code. The old request / response / adapter names are no longer the primary public surface.

## 3. Test-suite optimization

The repository test workflow was cleaned up and normalized around pytest.

### What changed

- a single formal entrypoint: `.venv\Scripts\python -m pytest`
- test discovery is defined by `pytest.ini`
- topic-based suite layout under `tests/`
- old script-style verification files were removed or converted to real pytest tests

### Current directories

- `tests/core`
- `tests/di`
- `tests/web`
- `tests/integration`
- `tests/regression`
- `tests/compat`
