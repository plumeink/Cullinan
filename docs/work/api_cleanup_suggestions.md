# API Cleanup Suggestions

This file lists suggested removals or visibility changes for automatically generated API tables. These are suggestions only — do not change code behavior here. Module owners should review and accept/reject each suggestion.

Generated from `docs/work/module_api_summary.json` on 2025-11-18.

## How to use
- Review the candidate symbols listed per module.
- If a symbol is internal/implementation detail, mark it `remove` and consider adding it to the module's `__all__` or make it private in code if appropriate.
- If a symbol is public API, mark `keep` and optionally add a short docstring/description in the docs.

## Suggested rules applied
- Exclude symbols whose defining module file is outside the repository (stdlib/third-party).
- Exclude module objects (modules imported into the module namespace).
- Exclude typing/noise (e.g., `Optional`, `List`, `Callable`) and logger/inspect/importlib references.
- Prefer keeping classes/functions that are defined in the module and intended as API (factory functions, decorators, registries, providers).

## cullinan.core  (REVIEW PRIORITY: HIGH)
Candidates (recommended action in parentheses):

- CircularDependencyError — keep (public error type)
- ClassProvider — keep (provider public API)
- ContextManager — review (likely internal; check usage; consider making private or documenting if public)
- CullinanCoreError — keep (public error)
- DependencyInjector — review (internal? keep only if part of public API)
- DependencyResolutionError — keep
- FactoryProvider — keep
- Inject — keep (important DI primitive)
- InjectByName — keep (DI primitive)
- InjectionRegistry — keep
- InstanceProvider — review (likely provider internals)
- LifecycleAware — review (used by lifecycle system; decide public)
- LifecycleError — keep
- LifecycleManager — review (internal manager vs API surface)
- LifecycleState — review
- Provider — review (base class; document or hide)
- ProviderRegistry — keep
- Registry — review
- RegistryError — keep
- RequestContext — keep (used by request-scoped DI)
- RequestScope — keep
- Scope — review
- ScopedProvider — keep
- SimpleRegistry — review
- SingletonScope — keep
- TransientScope — keep
- create_context — keep
- destroy_context — keep
- get_context_value — keep
- get_current_context — keep
- get_injection_registry — keep
- get_request_scope — keep
- get_singleton_scope — keep
- get_transient_scope — keep
- inject_constructor — keep
- injectable — keep
- reset_injection_registry — keep
- set_context_value — keep
- set_current_context — keep

Notes:
- Many classes are implementation primitives; for the docs we should surface only those that framework users need (Inject, injectable, injection registry accessors, Scope types, ProviderRegistry, and lifecycle hooks). Other classes like `ContextManager`, `LifecycleManager`, `Provider` base class might be considered internal unless used directly by end-users.
- Action: core-eng to mark each item keep/review/remove and provide brief rationale. The docs team will then prune tables accordingly.

## cullinan.application
Candidates:
- is_started_directly — review (utility; keep if documented)
- load_dotenv — review (utility)
- reflect_module — remove (likely internal)
- run — keep (application runtime)
- scan_controller — review (used for auto-scan; document as advanced)
- scan_service — review
- sort_url — remove (internal helper)

Notes: keep `run` and major entry points; hide small helpers if not intended for public use.

---

## cullinan.app
Candidates:
- CullinanApplication — keep
- create_app — keep

Notes: both are public API.

---

## cullinan.controller
Candidates (high-level suggestions):
- Keep: ControllerRegistry, Handler, controller decorator, get_controller_registry, get_header_registry, request_resolver, response helpers.
- Review/remove: internal pooling helpers or objects whose usage is internal (e.g., response pooling internals) — controller-eng to confirm.

---

## cullinan.service
Candidates:
- Keep: Service, ServiceRegistry, get_service_registry, reset_service_registry, service decorator

---

## Next steps
1. Module owners (core-eng, controller-eng, service-eng, app owner) should review `cullinan_core` and other module suggestions and respond with keep/review/remove decisions.
2. After decisions, we will prune the auto-generated markdown tables (or add an explicit `Public API` subsection) to reflect only intended public surface.
3. Optionally, update `generate_module_api.py` to include an allowlist/denylist or to read `__all__` where present.
