# Application Build

This knowledge domain is the **default starting point** for building a Cullinan application.

Cullinan wants application code to start from business decorators, business methods,
and the top-level `from cullinan import configure, run` API. This section therefore
keeps the shortest and safest path first.

## Start here

1. [Getting Started](../getting_started.md) — install Cullinan and run a minimal app
2. [Examples](../examples.md) — see small end-to-end examples
3. [Build & Run](../build_run.md) — local build and execution workflow

## What this section answers

- How do I bootstrap a new Cullinan application?
- What is the recommended entrypoint?
- What should a minimal application look like?
- Where do I go next after the first successful run?

## Recommended learning path

After you finish the minimal bootstrap path, continue with:

- [Framework Semantics](../framework_semantics.md) to understand Cullinan's rules
- [Engineering Practices](../how-to/index.md) for common development tasks
- [API Reference](../reference/index.md) when you already know what symbol you need

## Boundary note

This section intentionally avoids advanced runtime orchestration details. If you
need explicit runtime switching, low-level adapter work, or extension internals,
continue in [Internals & Extensions](../internals/index.md) instead of treating
those APIs as the default startup path.
