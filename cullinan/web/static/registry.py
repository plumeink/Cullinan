"""Startup-time registration of :class:`StaticFiles` mounts on the router.

Static mounts are translated into wildcard routes (``/<prefix>/**`` or
``/**`` for SPA root mounts) so they integrate with the existing dispatcher,
middleware pipeline, and runtime adapters without any engine-specific code.
